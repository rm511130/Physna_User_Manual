## 1. What is Physna and what is it not?
- Physna is a company on a journey to empower human creativity by connecting the physical and digital worlds. Physna was founded on the principle that computers should be taught to accurately “think” in 3D – sorting and analyzing geometric objects like written code. Physna is building a future where people have the tools they need to design and analyze the parts and products that shape our world, to create and drive innovation in product design, 3D printing, augmented and virtual reality, gaming, healthcare, and beyond.
- Physna Enterprise is a SaaS based solution that employs patented 3D geometry based algorithms and AI/ML neural networks to search, match and compare 3D models.
- Physna is not a CAD, PDM or PLM tool. 
- Physna does, however, expose its functionality as consumable APIs that can be used to integrate Physna's functionality into existing IT Applications to enhance your companies business processes.
- Physna offers training, consulting and professional services through partner organizations for the customization of the Physna Base Connector that enables uni or bi-directional movement of model and metadata information between PLM Solutions and Physna.

## 2. How do I access a Physna environment?
- As a customer, your Sales and Customer Success teams will have given you a URL to access your firewalled, dedicated, and encrypted Physna Environment. The URL will probably follow the structure __https://my-company.physna.com__ where _my_company_ is the name you agreed to use during initial implementation discussions with Physna's Customer Success team. 
- Ask your Business/Program/Project Leader or designated System Administrator what username you should use to log into your Physna environment. It will probably be your business Email Address or Single-Sign-On ID. If MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) has been implemented, you will be asked to follow your company's standard MFA procedures.
- Use [Google's Chrome Browser](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346) for better results. Other browsers have limitations that impede the use of all features.
- The Login Page is simple and comes with links in case you forget your username or password.
